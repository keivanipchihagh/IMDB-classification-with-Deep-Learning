 Classify IMDB reviews as positive/negative using One Hot Encoding, Word Embedding and Recurrent Neural Network implemented with *Deep Learning with Python by Francois Chollet* Book.
 
## Techniques
#### 1. One Hot Encoding (Chapter 3 - Getting started wiht neural networks)
#### 2. Task-spesific Word Embedding (Chapter 6 - Deep learning for text and sequences)
#### 3. Pretrained Word Embedding (Chapter 6 - Deep learning for text and sequences)
